## Prerequisites

Before installing the Mega CLI, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager

## Installing the CLI

You can install the Mega CLI globally using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g megaeth-cli

# Using yarn
yarn global add megaeth-cli

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -g megaeth-cli
```

After installation, you can verify that the CLI is properly installed by running:

```bash
mega
```

If it was installed correctly, you'll see something like this:

## Setting Up Foundry

Mega CLI requires [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for most of its commands. Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.

You can easily install Foundry using the built-in setup command:

```bash
mega setup
```

This command will:
- Check if Foundry is already installed
- On Linux/macOS: Automatically install Foundry
- On Windows: Guide you through the manual installation process

To only check if Foundry is installed without attempting installation:

```bash
mega setup --check
```

### Manual Foundry Installation

If you prefer to install Foundry manually:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/macOS">
    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    foundryup
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1. Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/
    2. Install Visual Studio build tools
    3. Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --profile release --locked forge cast chisel anvil
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Recommended: Setting Up a Local Account

For the optimal experience with MegaETH CLI, it's recommended to set up a local account:

```bash
# Create a new account
mega account create

# Verify your account was created successfully
mega account list
```

When creating an account:
1. You'll be prompted to enter a name for your wallet (e.g., "dev")
2. You'll need to set a password to encrypt your wallet
3. The account will be stored in your local keystore

Your account can now be referenced in other commands using the `--account` flag.
