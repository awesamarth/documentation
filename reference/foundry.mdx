# Foundry Reference

Mega CLI builds on top of [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), a powerful Ethereum development toolkit. This page provides a quick reference for Foundry tools that are used within Mega CLI.

<Note>
  For comprehensive documentation, refer to the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), which is the official documentation.
</Note>

## Foundry Components

Foundry consists of four main tools that are used throughout Mega CLI:

### Forge

Forge is a testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts.

```bash
# Test your contracts
forge test

# Run a specific test
forge test --match-test testFunctionName

# Run tests with verbosity
forge test -vvv
```

### Cast

Cast is a command-line tool for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions, and getting chain data.

```bash
# Get account balance
cast balance <address> --rpc-url <rpc-url>

# Call a contract function
cast call <contract-address> "functionName(uint256)" 123

# Send a transaction
cast send <contract-address> "functionName(uint256)" 123 --private-key <private-key>
```

### Anvil

Anvil is a local Ethereum node designed for development with configurable options.

```bash
# Start a local node
anvil

# Start with a specific chain ID
anvil --chain-id 1337

# Start with a specific block time
anvil --block-time 5
```

### Chisel

Chisel is a Solidity REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for quick code testing and prototyping.

```bash
# Start Chisel
chisel

# In Chisel, you can write and execute Solidity code directly
uint256 x = 5;
uint256 y = 10;
uint256 z = x + y;
z // Returns: 15
```
