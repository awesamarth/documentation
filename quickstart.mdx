## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Installed the Mega CLI globally (`npm install -g megaeth-cli`)
- Set up Foundry using `mega setup`
- Created a local account using `mega account create` (recommended)

If you haven't completed these steps yet, see the [Installation and Setup](/installation-and-setup) guide.

## Creating Your First Project

Mega CLI makes it easy to set up a new project with all the necessary configuration for MegaETH.

### Create a Full-Stack Project

```bash
# Create a new project
mega init my-mega-project

# Navigate to your new project
cd my-mega-project
```

This creates a full-stack project with both Foundry (for smart contracts) and Next.js (for frontend).

<Accordion title="What's included in the full-stack project?">
  - A Foundry environment configured for Mega testnet
  - A Next.js frontend with WalletConnect integration
  - Example smart contracts and frontend components
  - Configuration files and project structure
</Accordion>

### Start the Development Environment

Once your project is created, you can start the development environment:

```bash
mega dev
```

This command starts both:
- A local Anvil blockchain instance for development
- The Next.js development server for the frontend

You can also start them individually (recommended):

```bash
# Start only the Foundry/Anvil environment
mega dev --foundry

# Start only the Next.js frontend
mega dev --frontend
```

## Deploying Your First Contract

The starter project includes sample contracts you can deploy right away:

1. First, compile your contracts:

```bash
mega compile
```

2. Then, deploy to the local development chain:

```bash
mega deploy foundry-app/src/GmegaCounter.sol:GmegaCounter --broadcast
```

3. Or, deploy to the Mega testnet using your account:

```bash
mega deploy foundry-app/src/GmegaCounter.sol:GmegaCounter --broadcast --testnet --account <account-name>
```

<Note>
  Before deploying to testnet, make sure you have test tokens. You can request them using:
  
  ```bash
  mega faucet --account <account-name>
  ```
</Note>

## Checking Account Balance

You can check the balance of your account or any address:

```bash
# Check balance of your account
mega balance --account <account-name>

# Check balance of any address
mega balance 0x123...abc

# Show balance in ether instead of wei
mega balance --account dev --ether
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first project and explored the basic features, you can:

- Learn more about [project structure](/reference/project-structure)
- Explore the [command reference](/commands/setup) for detailed usage
- See [examples](/reference/examples) of common workflows
- 

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure Foundry is properly installed (`mega setup --check`)
- Check that you're using the latest version of Mega CLI
- For testnet operations, confirm you have test tokens in your account
