# mega dev

The `dev` command starts development environments for your Mega blockchain project.

## Usage

```bash
mega dev [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--foundry` | Start only the Foundry/Anvil local blockchain |
| `--frontend` | Start only the Next.js frontend |

## Description

This command detects and starts the appropriate development environments for your Mega project. By default, if both environments are detected, it starts both the Foundry/Anvil local blockchain and the Next.js frontend development server.

The command automatically:
- Detects Foundry and Next.js projects in the current directory or subdirectories
- Starts Anvil with appropriate configurations for local blockchain development
- Determines and uses the right package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm) for the frontend
- Provides convenient output with contract addresses and private keys

## Examples

### Start both environments

```bash
mega dev
```

### Start only the Foundry/Anvil local blockchain

```bash
mega dev --foundry
```

### Start only the Next.js frontend

```bash
mega dev --frontend
```

## Notes

- Press Ctrl+C to stop the development servers
- For cleaner logs, consider running the environments in separate terminals
- The Anvil blockchain runs on port 8545 by default
- The Next.js server typically runs on port 3000
