# mega faucet

The `faucet` command requests test tokens from the MegaETH testnet faucet.

## Usage

```bash
mega faucet [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--account <name>` | Use a keystore account from the default keystores folder |
| `--private-key <key>` | Use the provided private key |

## Description

This command allows you to request test tokens from the MegaETH testnet faucet. You must authenticate using either a stored account or a private key. The faucet has a cooldown period of 24 hours between requests from the same address.

Each successful request provides 0.00001 ETH to your address on the MegaETH testnet.

## Examples

### Request tokens using a stored account

```bash
mega faucet --account myaccount
```

### Request tokens using a private key

```bash
mega faucet --private-key 0x123...abc
```

## Notes

- You must provide either `--account` or `--private-key` to authenticate with the faucet
- Addresses are limited to one faucet claim every 24 hours
- After a successful request, you can check your balance with `mega balance`
- If you have extra Mega Testnet ETH and would like to support the faucet, you can transfer it directly to the contract which is deployed at: `0xaF5AA075cb327d83cB8D565D95202494569517a9`. This will help ensure the faucet doesn't run out of funds. Thank you :&#41;
