# mega compile

The `compile` command (also aliased as `mega build`) compiles Solidity contracts using Foundry's Forge under the hood.

## Usage

```bash
mega compile [options]
```

## Options

Mega CLI passes all options directly to Forge. Here are some commonly used options:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--names` | Print compiled contract names |
| `--sizes` | Print compiled non-test contract sizes |
| `--force` | Clear the cache and recompile |
| `--optimize` | Activate the Solidity optimizer |
| `--watch` | Watch for changes and recompile |

<Note>
  The `mega compile` command supports all options available in `forge build`. 
  See the [Forge documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-build) for a complete list.
</Note>

## Description

This command compiles your Solidity contracts using Foundry's Forge compiler. It's a wrapper around `forge build` that ensures compatibility with the Mega CLI workflow while providing access to all of Forge's powerful compilation options.

## Examples

### Basic compilation

```bash
mega compile
```

### Optimize contracts and show sizes

```bash
mega compile --optimize --sizes
```

### Watch for changes and recompile automatically

```bash
mega compile --watch
```

### Force recompilation by clearing the cache

```bash
mega compile --force
```
